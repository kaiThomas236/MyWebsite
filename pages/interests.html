    <dt><h4>Cars</h4></dt>
      <dd>I have a 1991 Mazda Miata and a 1993 Nissan hardbody. I have done multiple engine replacement jobs, as well as fun modifications such as when I retrofitted powered mirrors into my Miata.</dd>
      <dd>Working on cars is actually very similar to programming. The main distinction is that working on cars is a very physical activity, but the troubleshooting and problem solving are the same.</dd>

    <dt><h4>Games</h4></dt>
      <dd>I am currently in the middle of an Ark playthrough with my friends. Some other games I enjoy are Minecraft, Pokemon, TF2, Don't Starve, Satisfactory, Valheim, Portal, and Breath of the Wild. When I was younger I really enjoyed Fable 2 and 3,
        Halo, the Professor Layton games, and Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time.</dd>

    <dt><h4>Animals</h4></dt>
      <dd>I have a dog and two ferrets. All of my animals are named after satellites.</dd><br>

      <!--Bird-->
      <dd>This is Bird. She is a German Shorthaired Pointer mix who I adopted in 2022. She is named after an earth facing satellite, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIRD_(satellite)">Bispectral and Infrared Remote Detection</a></em>, which can be used to detect wildfires. The apartment we were living in when I adopted her nearly burned down in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Fire">Marshall Fire</a>, so this name has multiple layers of meaning.</dd>

      <!--Maven-->
      <dd>This is Maven. I have had him since 2017. He is named after a satellite in orbit around Mars, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAVEN">Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN</a>. Please don't call him Marvin >.< </dd>

      <!--Tess-->
      <dd>This is Tess. I adopted her in 2019, though she is roughly the same age as Maven. She is named after a space facing satellite searching for exoplanets using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Transit_photometry">transit method</a>, <a href="#">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a>.</dd>
